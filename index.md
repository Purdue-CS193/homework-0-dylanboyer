## Welcome to GitHub Pages

**HELLO!! WELCOME TO THE BEST WEBSITE EVER!!!!**
My name is Dylan Boyer, a CS student here at Purdue. This website is NO LONGER BORING because I had added things to it!
Fun fact: Did you know that the _only_ band to have ever performed live on all seven continents (yes! including Antartica!) is Metallica! They played for a ton of research scientists down there inside of a small dome in the Carlini Argentine Base in Antartica.
**So awesome!**

Everything below here are things I didn't feel like removing. This information is valuable, so feel free to look at it if you want to learn how I formatted this site!




You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/edit/master/index.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/kalutes/CS193_Fall18_Lab1/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
